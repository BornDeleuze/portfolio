      <p><em>"We make the road by walking"</em></p>

      <p>
        Matt comes from a strong tradition of DIY and creative problem solving, with an emphasis on collaboration.
      </p>
        <p>
          As a self-taught musician, sailor, and carpenter, Matt has honed the skill of learning new things. His music has let him tour 3 continents, his sailing has taken him across oceans and seas, and through carpentry he lives in a self-built timber framed cabin. His current area of study is now software engineering. At Marsh McLennan Agency, collaboration and ownership were the keystones of his role as a Junior Software Engineer. His tenure involved enhancing multiple Ember.js projects, creating a new business website, refactoring improper and stale codebases, generally paying down large amounts of technical debt, and ensuring adherence to the latest industry practices.
        </p>
        <p>
          Matt's background has also driven him to embrace collaborative and inclusive work environments. Whether in bands and boats, in community organizing, in learning settings, on the job, or in the collectively run business he helped form, he believes that everyone brings something to the table, and that collaborative work creates better outcomes.
        </p>
        <p>
          When Matt is not hacking you can find him in the forest hiking, sailing small boats, or helping run a small collective theatre project in Quilcene, Washington.
